MongoDB
    - No SQL
    - document oriented
    - written in c++
    - started development 2007

MongoDB stores data as documents as BSON file
as DBMS perspective,
    - Database = Database
    - Tables = Collections
    - Rows = Documents

for linux and mac,
    - mongod is the daemon server
    - mongo is the command-line shell
    - if no host:port is mentioned by default is localhost:27017
    - if wrong host:port combination is supplied then mongo client-shellfailed


inside mongo shell, 
    -> db points to current selected database
    -> show dbs/collections
    -> use db_name (if not exist then also create and select that for later use)
    -> db.collection_name (show/create(new) collection)
    -> db.collection_name.insert(BSON); insert a BSON (most close syntax to JSON) value/document
